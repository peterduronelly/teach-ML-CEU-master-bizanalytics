## Deep neural nets with `keras`

The [homepage](https://keras.rstudio.com/) has great descrpitions, expamples
and tutorials. Note: if you are really into building deeper neural nets, you'll
need computational power as well, like GPUs.

```{r}
library(keras)
mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y
```
```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
# show example of image
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37953644/r-image-plot-mnist-dataset
image(1:28, 1:28, x_train[18, , ], col=gray((0:255)/255))
```

```{r}
# reshape
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(dim(x_train)[1], 784)) 
x_test <- array_reshape(x_test, c(dim(x_test)[1], 784)) 
# rescale
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

# one-hot encoding of the target variable
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

```{r}
model <- keras_model_sequential() 
model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')
```

```{r}
summary(model)
```

```{r}
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
```

```{r}
history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train, 
  epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, 
  validation_split = 0.2
)
```

```{r}
model %>% evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

```{r}
model %>% predict_classes(x_test)
```
